    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Description:\n",
    "Watermarking has become a very critical tool in nullyfying the misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs), as these models can generate text that mimics human writing. There are a huge amount of risks associated, including pretending to be someone else and the generation of fake news. To combat these threats, the ability to trace the origin of generated text is crucial. As LLMs are increasingly used in academic and professional settings, this raises concerns about cheating, plagiarism, and authenticity. For instance, college students might use LLMs to generate essays, reports, or assignments without proper citation, undermining academic integrity. Similarly, in interviews, candidates may use LLMs to generate responses that appear original, leading to unfair advantages and misrepresentations of their actual abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context of the Problem:\n",
    "Existing watermarking techniques aim to embed imperceptible signals within the text generated by an LLM, allowing the text's origin to be identified later through a secret key. However, many of these methods face a significant trade-off between detectability and text quality. The current literature reveals that while passive methods for text forensics are versatile, they offer low performance with error rates that rarely dip below 10^-3. Active methods like watermarking, though more effective, typically introduce distortions in the text to achieve higher detectability, which compromises the quality of the generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rise of LLMs has further exacerbated the issue of plagiarism and cheating in education. As these models can generate human-like text on demand, students might exploit them to bypass the effort required for assignments, ultimately degrading the learning process and academic standards. In interviews, candidates might use LLMs to craft responses that appear intelligent and insightful but lack personal experience or understanding. This creates an unfair scenario where the candidate’s true capabilities are hidden, leading to unjust outcomes in hiring decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to detect such misuse through watermarking is essential, but it must be done without compromising the quality of the generated content. As a result, a reliable and robust watermarking technique is needed to address the growing concerns around cheating, plagiarism, and the overall integrity of systems that rely on generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitation About other Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Traditional Supervision (Hand-Labeled Data by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs))**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Semi-supervised Learning (Use of structural assumptions on unlabeled data)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*\t**Transfer Learning (Use of pre-trained models)**\n",

    "# 2. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "WaterMax introduces a black-box watermarking strategy that ensures robustness and fluency without accessing the internal workings of the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Watermark Score Function\n",
    "\n",
    "WaterMax defines a **scoring function** that evaluates how well a generated chunk aligns with a seeded statistical signature. This function enables the system to rank candidate chunks based on how detectable and consistent their watermark signals are.\n",
    "\n",
    "The watermark score \\( S \\) for a chunk is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "S = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\delta\\left( \\text{chunk}_i \\oplus \\text{key}_i \\right)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( \\delta \\) returns 1 if the tokens match and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "- \\( n \\) is the number of tokens in the chunk.\n",
    "- \\( \\text{chunk}_i \\) and \\( \\text{key}_i \\) represent the i-th token in the chunk and the watermark key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Text Space\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of modifying token distributions, WaterMax performs **draft-and-select**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple candidate chunks are sampled using the base LLM.\n",
    "- The scoring function evaluates each candidate chunk.\n",
    "- The chunk with the best score is selected.\n",
    "- This process repeats chunk by chunk until the full text is generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows WaterMax to embed watermarks in a **black-box setting** without sacrificing text quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detection Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Watermark detection is performed using a **likelihood ratio test (LRT)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P_{\\text{watermark}} = \\frac{\\text{score of watermark chunk}}{\\text{score of random chunk}}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- This test compares the probability of the text being generated with vs. without the watermark under the known seed.\n",
    "- If the ratio exceeds a threshold, the text is classified as watermarked.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Robustness to Adversarial Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "WaterMax enhances robustness through **chunk-based watermarking**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Watermarks are independently embedded in each chunk.\n",
    "- Local edits (e.g., paraphrasing) only affect some chunks, leaving others intact.\n",
    "- This design improves resistance against common attacks compared to continuous watermarking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tuning the Trade-off between Fidelity and Detectability\n",
    "\n",
    "WaterMax introduces a **tuning knob** that balances watermark strength and fluency:\n",
    "\n",
    "- More drafts = stronger watermark signal, slightly lower fluency.\n",
    "- Fewer drafts = higher fluency, slightly weaker watermark.\n",
    "\n",
    "This trade-off allows adapting the watermarking strategy based on application needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we outline the solution provided by **WaterMax** for embedding a watermark into text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach leverages a detector-first design that maximizes detection power while ensuring high-quality, fluent text generation. Below, we explain the key components of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1. Watermark Embedding Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**WaterMax** employs a robust watermark embedding strategy that is based on a **chunk-level selection process**. This process enables embedding watermarks without modifying the core architecture or components of the LLM, ensuring the model's functionality remains intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps in Watermark Embedding:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chunk Generation**: For each segment of the text, multiple candidate chunks are generated using the LLM.\n",
    "- **Watermark Score Calculation**: Each candidate chunk is evaluated using the **watermark score function**, which calculates the similarity between the chunk and a pre-defined watermark key.\n",
    "- **Best Chunk Selection**: The chunk with the highest watermark score is selected, ensuring that the watermark is embedded without sacrificing fluency.\n",
    "- **Iterative Process**: This chunk-based embedding process is repeated for each text segment, ensuring that the watermark is efficiently embedded in the entire text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process guarantees that the watermark is seamlessly embedded without requiring internal model modifications, preserving the LLM's original performance and output quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2. Detection Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the watermark is embedded, it can be detected using a **likelihood ratio test (LRT)**. This test allows for the identification of the watermark in the text without requiring access to the internal parameters of the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Likelihood Ratio Test for Watermark Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Functionality**: The LRT compares the likelihood of the text being generated with or without the watermark under the known seeded key.\n",
    "- **No Need for Model Access**: Unlike traditional methods, **WaterMax** does not require access to the LLM's internals (such as logits or weights).\n",
    "- **Detection Formula**: The detection is based on the following formula:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  P_{\\text{watermark}} = \\frac{\\text{score of watermark chunk}}{\\text{score of random chunk}}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "  If the ratio exceeds a defined threshold, the text is flagged as watermarked.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3. Robustness and Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "**WaterMax** is designed to be robust against various adversarial attacks such as paraphrasing or text manipulation. The use of independent chunks ensures that partial changes in the text do not affect the entire watermark, making it resilient to local edits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of WaterMax's Robustness:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chunk-Based Design**: The watermark is embedded across multiple independent chunks of text, increasing robustness.\n",
    "- **Local Impact of Edits**: Any changes or edits to individual chunks affect only those specific chunks, preserving the watermark in the rest of the text.\n",
    "- **Resiliency to Paraphrasing**: The chunk-based design makes it harder for attackers to remove or alter the watermark without significantly degrading the overall text quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, **WaterMax** is highly scalable, able to handle large volumes of text generation without significant loss in performance or detection accuracy. The computational complexity remains manageable thanks to modern GPU parallelization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.4. Key Benefits of the WaterMax Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The **WaterMax** watermarking scheme offers several notable benefits that differentiate it from previous approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Detection Accuracy**: Even on short texts, **WaterMax** achieves near-perfect detection accuracy.\n",
    "- **Minimal Impact on Text Quality**: Unlike previous methods, **WaterMax** ensures that the watermark embedding process does not degrade the fluency or readability of the text.\n",
    "- **No Model Modification**: **WaterMax** operates as a black-box approach, ensuring that the LLM’s core functionality remains unchanged, allowing for easy integration with pre-existing models.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: The solution is highly scalable and can be applied to large datasets or real-time text generation scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**WaterMax** stands out as a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for watermarking text generated by LLMs, offering high detection rates while maintaining text quality.\n",

One concept that he wrote about is \"ritournelle,\" which is French for \"round trip\" or \"return journey.\" In Deleuze\\'s philosophy, ritournelle refers to the process of repetition and return, which he believed was fundamental to the creation of new ideas and the transformation of societies.\\n\\nAccording to Deleuze, ritournelle is a concept that is closely related to his ideas about difference and repetition. In his view, repetition is not simply a matter of repeating something that has already been said or done, but rather it involves the creation of new connections and relationships between different elements. When we repeat something, we are not simply reiterating the same old idea or action, but rather we are creating a new network of relationships that can lead to new insights and innovations.\\n\\nFor Deleuze, the process of ritournelle involves the continuous cycling of ideas and practices through a series of transformations and reinterpretations.

The Working Group classified consumption of red meat as \\\\u2018probably carcinogenic to humans\\\\u2019,\\\\u201d it added.\\\\n\\\\u201cThe experts concluded that each 50 gram portion of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 18 percent,\\\\u201d the IARC said. \\\\u201cFor an individual, the risk of developing colorectal cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but this risk increases with the amount of meat consumed,\\\\u201d said IARC\\\\u2019s Dr. Kurt Straif.\\\\n\\\\u201cRed meat refers to unprocessed mammalian muscle meat\\\\u2014for example, beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton, horse, or goat meat\\\\u2014including minced or frozen meat; it is usually consumed cooked,\\\\u201d the IARC said in its report.\\\\nRed meat was included in a lower category, which means that while there is evidence for it causing cancer, there is still quite a lot of room for debate.

The agency\\'s report states that consuming 50 grams of processed meat per day increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 18%.\\n\\nWhile there is still some debate around the association between red meat and cancer, the IARC\\'s findings are consistent with previous studies that have shown a link between processed meat consumption and increased cancer risk. It is important to note that the risk of cancer associated with red meat consumption remains small, but it can increase with the amount of meat consumed.\\n\\nTo reduce the risk of cancer, the IARC recommends', 'speed': 0.09406194164581487, 'eta': '02h01m54s'}\n",

Always respond truthfully and to the best of your ability. <</SYS>> Was it a surprise to you that you were given the arts and culture position?\\\\nNo, there is no surprise when you are a cadre of the ANC because you are deployed anywhere. You are given a five-year contract to do a portfolio and when you are finished, you wait for another one. At no stage do you have a say.\\\\nWhat qualities do you bring to the position?\\\\nPeople say to me you are a minister here but you can\\\\u2019t sing; how can you survive in the sector? It\\\\u2019s not about that.\\\\nIf you attend some of the meetings of the ANC, you will see that I lead revolutionary songs. I know I can command a revolutionary song.\\\\nI will be working with stakeholders and cultural activists and we will be going on a journey together. We will bring our understanding and our connection with young people.\\\\nThis is an area that is, by and large, filled with practitioners who are young, with hopes for the future and dreams.\\\\nWhat would be important would be to bring that strategic leadership to the sector, primarily to co-ordinate the endeavours that have been started by my predecessors.\\\\nWhat are\", \"baseline\": \"the first things you will tackle?\\\\nOn my first day I had a briefing on what has happened in the department and what we need to do. I immediately raised the issue that we are writing the true history of South Africa through the voices of its people, rather than through colonialists.\\\\nWe need a single national monument where everybody who comes to South Africa will be able to understand our history. It has to be brand- new. No nation has come through what we have come through without that kind of recognition and national monument.\\\\nSouth Africa has a very rich history that needs to be taught properly. Things such as the Anglo-Boer War need to be taught fully, so that we would see that it was a South African war where everyone had a role. There is this strong feeling I have that it is important that we acknowledge all our history.\\\\nOne thing we have to do is measure the contribution of arts to the big picture. Take for instance the yearly jazz festival in Cape Town. When people go there they talk about one aspect, which is tourism, but they forget that at the core it is arts and culture. They go there to connect spiritually with their needs. It is very important. I also want more people coming here to produce movies.\\\\nI see arts as helping a young democracy that is competing with old democracies. We are still finding our way. I want to see South Africans being given an opportunity to reflect on themselves on a yearly basis. Heritage is very important because this is where we are grooming our people to understand [our cultural history]. By identifying young people and giving them a chance to study, we are creating a reservoir for the future.\\\\nWe must also find a way of promoting all our languages. Some of them are seen as being inferior, which is a mistake. We also have to develop our unofficial languages, such as that of the amaPondo. When we develop them we are saying: \\\\u2018We understand your culture, we know who you are and we want to see you prospering.\\\\u2019 It is a huge task.\\\\nWho do you listen to?\\\\nI do not have a favourite because my point of view is that of an internationalist, where I listen to music from around Africa \\\\u2013 Senegalese and Congolese music \\\\u2013 and the world. I particularly enjoy jazz and soul. When I sit down to reflect and take stock I listen to jazz, and on a really bad day it is soul music. I like Richard Nwamba\\\\u2019s African Connection [programme on SAfm]because it brings that music from across the continent. It\\\\u2019s a pity that it is only once a week; I would like to have it during the week too.\\\\nWe need to take better care of our artists. They entertain us and they become our celebrities, but in the end they die in very difficult circumstances. We need to improve their lives. They helped us to attain freedom and they are creating a new South Africa. Look at kwaito, which was an initiative of young people without anyone guiding them.\\\\nDo the arts get enough financial support?\\\\nI still have to see the fullness of the sector, but I would probably want arts to have more concentration in the sector. I am not sure it would only be financial. If you go to other countries, arts and culture are the things that unite people. They play a big role, like with sports and recreation.\\\\nI am excited because of the potential that I feel we can unearth here. This is a junior department to others, but what can be more senior than leading a nation to identify itself? A nation that does not understand its soul is not worthy to be called a nation.\\\\nAre there limits to freedom of expression? What about The Spear painting?\\\\nOne area that we really fought for very hard is what is contained in the Bill of Rights: people have to express themselves. When you do that, you would be responsible and not express yourself to incite violence. When it comes to The Spear I can\\\\u2019t say it is up to the minister to say what people must express. Whatever we do as a nascent demo-cracy, we must respect others.\\\\nI\\\\u2019m taking my point of view from the values of ubuntu, with the caring and sharing of Africans.\\\\nBut other people have their own views.\\\\nAre you going to any shows this weekend?\\\\nI am going to the office as we speak for consultations, and I will still be doing that this weekend. Obviously I will be going to any events that I can, because you can\\\\u2019t be something that you do not understand fully. It is one of the perks.\\\\nWe have become a crass, materialistic society to the detriment of our most important needs \\\\u2013 our spirits and our emotions. We cannot continue that way, because we are missing that sense of belonging.\\n [/INST]', 'result': \"  As a helpful assistant, I must inform you that the person you are speaking to is not a minister, but rather a cadre of the African National Congress (ANC).

The contrast between Don Quixote\\'s idealized vision of chivalry and the harsh realities of the world he encounters highlights the disparity between the dreams of youth and the hardships of adulthood.\\n\\nCharacterization:\\nCervantes\\' characterization of Don Quixote is complex and nuanced, capturing the reader\\'s attention through his humor, charm, and vulnerability. Don Quixote\\'s delusions are both tragic and comical, as he oscillates between grandeur and folly. Sancho Panza serves as a foil to Don Quixote, providing a more grounded perspective on the world and serving as a voice of reason. The other characters in the novel, such as the innkeeper\\'s daughter and the duke and duchess, are equally well-developed, adding depth and richness to the narrative.\\n\\nThemes:\\nSome of the themes explored in Don Quixote include the blurring of reality and fantasy, the power of imagination, and the decline of chivalry. The novel also touches on themes of social satire, poking fun at the excesses of the nobility and the shortcomings of society. Cervantes also explores the idea of the \"eternal knight,\" suggesting that chivalry and honor are timeless ideals that transcend the ages.\\n\\nStyle:\\nCervantes\\' writing style is characterized by its simplicity, clarity, and humor. He employs a straightforward narrative style, using a third-person omniscient perspective to convey the story. The novel\\'s humor is often satirical and ironic, with Cervantes using wit and wordplay to poking fun at the absurdities of life. The novel\\'s structure, divided into two parts, adds a sense of balance and symmetry, underscoring the themes of balance and harmony.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nDon Quixote is a timeless tale of chivalry and delusion, a literary masterpiece that has captured the imagination of readers for centuries. Cervantes\\' clever and nuanced exploration of the human condition through the eyes of a delusional nobleman has earned the novel a place as one of the greatest works of literature ever written. As such, it remains an essential read for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the human experience and the power of literature to shape our perceptions of the world.', 'ppl': 5.07421875}\n",

The room was dimly lit, the only light coming from a small table lamp by the bed. The victim, John Smith, lay on his back, a single bullet wound in his chest.\\n\\nJameson knelt down beside the body and examined it closely. \"What do we know about the victim?\" he asked his partner, Detective Rodriguez, who stood in the doorway.\\n\\n\"Not much,\" Rodriguez replied. \"He was found by his assistant around 10 pm last night. No signs of forced entry or struggle.\"\\n\\nJameson nodded, taking in the information. \"Any idea who might have wanted him dead?\"\\n\\nRodriguez shook his head. \"None that we know of. Smith was a wealthy man, but he didn\\'t have any known enemies.\"\\n\\nJameson stood up and began pacing the room, his mind racing with possibilities. \"We need to talk to the assistant,\" he said. \"And find out who else was in the mansion last night.\"\\n\\nRodriguez nodded, and the two detectives set to work, canvassing the mansion and interviewing the staff. As they investigation progressed, they discovered that Smith had been leading a secret life, one that could have led to his murder.\\n\\nAs the night wore on, Jameson and Rodriguez pieced together the events of the fateful night. They found that Smith had been in the mansion with his assistant, but had also been entertaining a young woman, Sarah, in the library.\\n\\nIt seemed that Sarah had a connection to Smith that no one knew about, and she had been seen arguing with him earlier that night. But as the detectives dug deeper, they discovered that Sarah was not who she seemed to be. In fact, she was an alias, and the real identity of the woman was much more sinister.\\n\\nAs the investigation continued, Jameson and Rodriguez found themselves unraveling a complex web of lies and deceit, leading them to the real killer. In the end, they discovered that Smith\\'s murder was not just a random act of violence, but a premeditated crime, orchestrated by someone with a motive.\\n\\nAnd as they closed the case, Jameson couldn\\'t help but wonder how many more secrets lay hidden behind the walls of that old mansion, waiting to be uncovered.', 'ppl': 4.8515625}\n",
